# Spark Dynamic Resource Allocation Research

## Overview
- Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) in Spark allows adjusting resources based on workload.
- It's particularly useful for sharing resources among multiple applications in a Spark cluster.
- Available on coarse-grained cluster managers: standalone mode, YARN mode, Mesos coarse-grained mode, and K8s mode.

## How it works
1. Requests additional executors when there are pending tasks.
2. Removes executors when they've been idle for a specified time.
3. Uses an exponential increase policy for requesting executors.

## Configuration
- Enable with `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled` set to `true`.
- Requires either:
  a) External shuffle service (`spark.shuffle.service.enabled` = `true`)
  b) Shuffle tracking (`spark.dynamicAllocation.shuffleTracking.enabled` = `true`)
  c) Decommissioning (`spark.decommission.enabled` and `spark.storage.decommission.shuffleBlocks.enabled` = `true`)
  d) Custom ShuffleDataIO with reliable storage

## Potential Benefits
- Efficient resource utilization for jobs with unknown or varying loads.
- Automatic scaling based on actual demand.
- Improved cluster utilization when multiple applications share resources.
- Potential cost savings by reducing idle resources.

## Potential Drawbacks
- Overhead of starting and stopping executors.
- Potential reshuffling costs when scaling up executors.
- Complexity in configuration and tuning for optimal performance.

## Comparison to Static Allocation
1. Resource Efficiency:
   - DRA can potentially be more efficient for jobs with varying or unpredictable workloads.
   - Static allocation may overprovision resources, leading to idle executors and wasted resources.

2. Performance:
   - DRA may introduce some overhead due to executor allocation/deallocation.
   - Static allocation might have more consistent performance for well-understood, stable workloads.

3. Computational Cost:
   - DRA could be less expensive computationally for jobs with fluctuating resource needs, as it can scale down during low-demand periods.
   - Static allocation might be less expensive for jobs with consistent, predictable resource requirements, as it avoids the overhead of frequent scaling.

4. Flexibility:
   - DRA offers greater adaptability to changing workloads and cluster conditions.
   - Static allocation requires manual tuning and may not adapt well to changing conditions.

5. Complexity:
   - DRA requires more complex configuration and may be harder to troubleshoot.
   - Static allocation is simpler to set up and understand.

## Preliminary Conclusions
Based on the available information, dynamic allocation can be less expensive computationally compared to hard-coding the number of executors in scenarios where:
1. Workloads are unpredictable or highly variable.
2. Multiple applications share cluster resources.
3. The benefits of efficient resource utilization outweigh the overhead of executor allocation/deallocation.

However, for well-understood, stable workloads with consistent resource requirements, static allocation might still be more efficient due to its simplicity and lack of scaling overhead.

## Questions for Further Research
1. What is the exact computational cost of reshuffling when scaling up executors?
2. How does the efficiency compare to hard-coding executor numbers for various specific workload patterns?
3. Are there quantitative benchmarks comparing DRA and static allocation in different scenarios?
4. What are the best practices for tuning DRA to minimize overhead and maximize efficiency?
