This is a sample input file for our Spark word count job.
It contains multiple lines with various words.
Some words may appear multiple times in this file.
The word count job will count the occurrences of each word.
Spark dynamic allocation and static allocation will be compared using this input.
We will measure the computational efficiency of both approaches.
The experiment aims to determine if dynamic allocation is beneficial for batch jobs with unknown loads.
